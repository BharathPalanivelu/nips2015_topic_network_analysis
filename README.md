Topic Modeling and Network Analysis: NIPS 2015

Topic Modeling: Used LDA to find the topics presented at NIPS'15 (CS conference). Scrapped the web for citation counts of the papers. Found the most impactful topics from NIPS'15 and used T-SNE to visualize. (Gensim, LDA, pyLDAvis, T-SNE, Bokeh)

Network analysis: Constructed collaboration network at NIPS'15. Used K-mean clustering to classify authors based on their career stage and visualized the network. (K-mean, PCA, Networkx, Plotly)
